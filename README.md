# Breast-cancer-detection-using-Logistic-Regression
This is a Model which can Predict the Breast Cancer
## Logistic Regression

The Regression Model types are very adaptive to Linear Datasets as well as Binary Datasets .



* I Founded the Dataset in [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).

* I am using **Sigmoid** function to tolerate the intercepts and to have a Nice curve for the beginning and the end

* You can use Different Optimizers as well<br>
I used [Adam](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/intuition-of-adam-optimizer/). You can also use Different Optimizers like [RMSprop](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/rmsprop), Which will give the same results.

## Accuracy 

The accuracy is about 92 percent

*If you want to increase the accuracy by giving more data or increase the dataset and adding new parameters and do Hyperparameter Tuning*
